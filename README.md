# About Mini-Mail
A free, open-source e-mail client for IOS!

## Purpose
On IOS, there is a very small amount of open-source email clients that connect email accounts from various email providers. Only a few email providers provide their own open-source apps, but they only connect to their respective email domains. 

## Current Status
I am still learning Swift, and there is no way I can deploy the app on the App Store without a Mac Device and Xcode. So this will probably be postponed until I can find a partner or a group who I can collaborate with and could deploy the app on the App Store.
