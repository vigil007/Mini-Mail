# About Mini-Mail
Mini-Mail is a free, open-source e-mail client for IOS!

## Purpose
On IOS, there is a very small amount of open-source email clients that connect email accounts from various email providers. Only a few email providers such as Protonmail and Tutanota provide their own open-source apps, but they only connect to their respective email domains. Another reason as to why I am interested in developing a tracker and ad-free mail app is that I would rather reduce my dependancy on Apple Mail.

## Current Status
I am still learning Swift, and there is no way I can deploy the app on the App Store without a Mac Device and Xcode. So this will probably be postponed until I can find a partner or a group who I can collaborate with and could deploy the app on the App Store.
