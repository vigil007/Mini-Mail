# About Mini-Mail
Mini-Mail is a free, open-source e-mail client for IOS!

## Purpose
On IOS, there are a very small amount of open-source email clients that connect email accounts from various email providers. Only a few email providers such as Protonmail and Tutanota provide their own open-source apps, but they only connect to their respective email domains. Another reason as to why I am interested in developing a tracker and ad-free mail app is that I would like reduce my dependancy on Apple Mail.

## Current Status
I am still learning Swift, and that will take some time first before I begin to develop the app.
