# About Mini-Mail
Mini-Mail is a free, open-source e-mail client for IOS!

## Purpose
On IOS, there is a very small amount of open-source email clients that connect email accounts from various email providers. Only a few email providers such as Protonmail and Tutanota provide their own open-source apps, but they only connect to their respective email domains. I am also unsure about user tracking with the Apple Mail app, which is what motivated me to create this app.

## Current Status
I am still learning Swift, and there is no way I can deploy the app on the App Store without a Mac Device and Xcode. So this will probably be postponed until I can find a partner or a group who I can collaborate with and could deploy the app on the App Store.
